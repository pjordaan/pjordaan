[![Hi there, I'm Pieter Jordaan. Thank you for visiting my github profile.](https://readme-typing-svg.demolab.com?font=Fira+Code&pause=1000&width=435&lines=Hi+there%2C+I'm+Pieter+Jordaan.;Thank+you+for+visiting+my+profile.)](https://git.io/typing-svg)

My name is Pieter Jordaan. I'm a lead developer at Paqt in Utrecht in the Netherlands. In my spare time I work on the Apie library, which is a
very ambitious project that centralizes around domain objects. It's still a work in progress and I put a lot of spare time hours on it.

# üå©Ô∏è A quick introduction
As other hobbies: I play videogames, playing guitar and cycling. I have a wife and 4 children that also require my attention.
